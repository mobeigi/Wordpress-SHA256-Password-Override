Wordpress SHA256 Password Override
=========================
A short plugin to force Wordpress to use SHA-256 + a salt when hashing and checking passwords.

I used this plugin algorithm website to change the hashing algorithm on two wordpress websites I own.  
My own personal website at http://mohammadg.com and an Article Directory (used by other users) at http://www.articlevoid.com use this plugin.
